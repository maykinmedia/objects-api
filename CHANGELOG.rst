2.3.2 (2024-05-03)
------------------

Bugfix release

This release addresses a security weakness.

* [GHSA-3wcp-29hm-g82c] replaced PK for Token model.


2.3.1 (2024-03-22)
------------------

**Bugfixes and QOL**

* fixed celery docker container (#376)
* configured caches with redis (#377)
* added flower to monitor celery tasks (#378)

.. note::

    Flower is added to the docker, so now flower container could be deployed for monitoring
    purposes.


2.3.0 (2024-03-15)
------------------

* Updated to Django 4.2.

.. warning::

    Celery (and thus Redis) is now a required dependency.

    Two-factor authentication is enabled by default. The ``DISABLE_2FA`` environment variable
    can be used to disable it if needed.

* **Bugfixes**

  * added `typeVersion` query parameter (#306)

.. warning::

   Change in deployment is required. `/media/` volume should be configured to share OAS files.

   Explanation:

   The new version of ``zgw_consumers`` library adds ``oas_file`` filed to ``Service`` model.
   This field saves OAS file into ``MEDIA_ROOT`` folder.
   The deployment now should have a volume for it.
   Please look at the example in ``docker-compose.yml``
