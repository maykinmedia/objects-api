.. warning::

    ``SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS`` has been added with a default of 31536000 seconds, ensure that
    before upgrading to this version of open-api-framework, your entire application is served

    (see ``Installation > Environment configuration reference`` in the documentation on how to configure) the connection with Redis

.. warning::

    The service name for Elastic APM is now configurable via the ``ELASTIC_APM_SERVICE_NAME`` environment variable.

2.3.2 (2024-05-03)
------------------

Bugfix release

   Change in deployment is required. `/media/` volume should be configured to share OAS files.

   Explanation:

   The new version of ``zgw_consumers`` library adds ``oas_file`` filed to ``Service`` model.
   This field saves OAS file into ``MEDIA_ROOT`` folder.
   The deployment now should have a volume for it.
   Please look at the example in ``docker-compose.yml``
