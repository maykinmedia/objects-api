Introduction
============

To store and expose various types of domain specific data, or objects, we need
an appropriate API. Domain specific objects can be a "signal", "dog", "tree",
"parking permit", "complaint", "family", or anything really.

Organizations (specifically municipalities) want to store, retrieve and connect
these different kind of objects. For example: A "Zaak" (Case) should be able to refer
to a "tree", or all "trees" need to be shown on a geographic map.

These object registrations are necessary in the IT-landscape to create domain
specific applications according to the Common Ground principles.
Standardization of the object definitions is necessary to prevent divergent
solutions and implementations.

The power of this setup is that as soon as you create or allow an objecttype,
you can start storing objects of that objecttype. No deploy, setup,
configuration or development needed.
