Documentation
=============

Open Objecten consists of two API's. The :ref:`Objecttypes API` & the :ref:`Objects API`.
The Objecttypes api contains the object definitions and the Objects API the instances.

Designed in line with the `Common Ground`_ model, they can be used by other APIs that need
to store object specific data.

Open Objecten is and only uses :ref:`introduction_open-source`.
