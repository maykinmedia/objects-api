===================================
Environment configuration reference
===================================


The Objects and Objecttypes APIs can be run both as a Docker container or a VPS / dedicated server.
It relies on other services, such as database and cache backends, which can be configured through environment variables.


Available environment variables
===============================


Required
--------

* ``SECRET_KEY``: Secret key that's used for certain cryptographic utilities. .
* ``ALLOWED_HOSTS``: a comma separated (without spaces!) list of domains that serve the installation. Used to protect against Host header attacks. Defaults to: ``(empty string)``.
* ``CACHE_DEFAULT``: redis cache address for the default cache (this **MUST** be set when using Docker). Defaults to: ``localhost:6379/0``.
* ``CACHE_AXES``: redis cache address for the brute force login protection cache (this **MUST** be set when using Docker). Defaults to: ``localhost:6379/0``.
* ``EMAIL_HOST``: hostname for the outgoing e-mail server (this **MUST** be set when using Docker). Defaults to: ``localhost``.


Database
--------

* ``DB_NAME``: name of the PostgreSQL database. Defaults to: ``objects``.
* ``DB_USER``: username of the database user. Defaults to: ``objects``.
* ``DB_PASSWORD``: password of the database user. Defaults to: ``objects``.
* ``DB_HOST``: hostname of the PostgreSQL database. Defaults to ``db`` for the docker environment, otherwise defaults to ``localhost``.
* ``DB_PORT``: port number of the database. Defaults to: ``5432``.


Cross-Origin-Resource-Sharing
-----------------------------

* ``CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS``: allow cross-domain access from any client. Defaults to: ``False``.
* ``CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS``: explicitly list the allowed origins for cross-domain requests. Example: http://localhost:3000,https://some-app.gemeente.nl. Defaults to: ``[]``.
* ``CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN_REGEXES``: same as ``CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS``, but supports regular expressions. Defaults to: ``[]``.
* ``CORS_EXTRA_ALLOW_HEADERS``: headers that are allowed to be sent as part of the cross-domain request. By default, Authorization, Accept-Crs and Content-Crs are already included. The value of this variable is added to these already included headers. Defaults to: ``[]``.


Celery
------

* ``CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND``: the URL of the backend/broker that will be used by Celery to send the notifications. Defaults to: ``redis://localhost:6379/1``.
* ``CELERY_TASK_HARD_TIME_LIMIT``: Task hard time limit in seconds. The worker processing the task will be killed and replaced with a new one when this is exceeded. Defaults to: ``900``.


Elastic APM
-----------

* ``ELASTIC_APM_SERVER_URL``: URL where Elastic APM is hosted. Defaults to: ``None``.
* ``ELASTIC_APM_SERVICE_NAME``: Name of the service for this application in Elastic APM. Defaults to ``objects - <environment>``.
* ``ELASTIC_APM_SECRET_TOKEN``: Token used to communicate with Elastic APM. Defaults to: ``default``.
* ``ELASTIC_APM_TRANSACTION_SAMPLE_RATE``: By default, the agent will sample every transaction (e.g. request to your service). To reduce overhead and storage requirements, set the sample rate to a value between 0.0 and 1.0. Defaults to: ``0.1``.


Content Security Policy
-----------------------

* ``CSP_EXTRA_DEFAULT_SRC``: Extra default source URLs for CSP other than ``self``. Used for ``img-src``, ``style-src`` and ``script-src``. Defaults to: ``[]``.
* ``CSP_REPORT_URI``: URI of the``report-uri`` directive. Defaults to: ``None``.
* ``CSP_REPORT_PERCENTAGE``: Percentage of requests that get the ``report-uri`` directive. Defaults to: ``0``.
* ``CSP_EXTRA_FORM_ACTION``: Add additional ``form-action`` source to the default . Defaults to: ``[]``.
* ``CSP_FORM_ACTION``: Override the default ``form-action`` source. Defaults to: ``['"\'self\'"']``.
* ``CSP_EXTRA_IMG_SRC``: Extra ``img-src`` sources for CSP other than ``CSP_DEFAULT_SRC``. Defaults to: ``[]``.
* ``CSP_OBJECT_SRC``: ``object-src`` urls. Defaults to: ``['"\'none\'"']``.


Optional
--------

* ``SITE_ID``: The database ID of the site object. You usually won't have to touch this. Defaults to: ``1``.
* ``DEBUG``: Only set this to ``True`` on a local development environment. Various other security settings are derived from this setting!. Defaults to: ``False``.
* ``USE_X_FORWARDED_HOST``: whether to grab the domain/host from the X-Forwarded-Host header or not. This header is typically set by reverse proxies (such as nginx, traefik, Apache...). Note: this is a header that can be spoofed and you need to ensure you control it before enabling this. Defaults to: ``False``.
* ``IS_HTTPS``: Used to construct absolute URLs and controls a variety of security settings. Defaults to the inverse of ``DEBUG``.
* ``EMAIL_PORT``: port number of the outgoing e-mail server. Note that if you're on Google Cloud, sending e-mail via port 25 is completely blocked and you should use 487 for TLS. Defaults to: ``25``.
* ``EMAIL_HOST_USER``: username to connect to the mail server. Defaults to: ``(empty string)``.
* ``EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD``: password to connect to the mail server. Defaults to: ``(empty string)``.
* ``EMAIL_USE_TLS``: whether to use TLS or not to connect to the mail server. Should be True if you're changing the ``EMAIL_PORT`` to 487. Defaults to: ``False``.
* ``DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL``: The default email address from which emails are sent. Defaults to: ``objects@example.com``.
* ``LOG_STDOUT``: whether to log to stdout or not. Defaults to: ``True``.
* ``LOG_LEVEL``: control the verbosity of logging output. Available values are ``CRITICAL``, ``ERROR``, ``WARNING``, ``INFO`` and ``DEBUG``. Defaults to: ``WARNING``.
* ``LOG_QUERIES``: enable (query) logging at the database backend level. Note that you must also set ``DEBUG=1``, which should be done very sparingly!. Defaults to: ``False``.
* ``LOG_REQUESTS``: enable logging of the outgoing requests. Defaults to: ``False``.
* ``CELERY_LOGLEVEL``: control the verbosity of logging output for celery, independent of ``LOG_LEVEL``. Available values are ``CRITICAL``, ``ERROR``, ``WARNING``, ``INFO`` and ``DEBUG``. Defaults to: ``INFO``.
* ``SESSION_COOKIE_AGE``: For how long, in seconds, the session cookie will be valid. Defaults to: ``1209600``.
* ``SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE``: The value of the SameSite flag on the session cookie. This flag prevents the cookie from being sent in cross-site requests thus preventing CSRF attacks and making some methods of stealing session cookie impossible.Currently interferes with OIDC. Keep the value set at Lax if used. Defaults to: ``Lax``.
* ``CSRF_COOKIE_SAMESITE``: The value of the SameSite flag on the CSRF cookie. This flag prevents the cookie from being sent in cross-site requests. Defaults to: ``Strict``.
* ``ENVIRONMENT``: An identifier for the environment, displayed in the admin depending on the settings module used and included in the error monitoring (see ``SENTRY_DSN``). The default is set according to ``DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE``.
* ``SUBPATH``: If hosted on a subpath, provide the value here. If you provide ``/gateway``, the component assumes its running at the base URL: ``https://somedomain/gateway/``. Defaults to an empty string. Defaults to: ``None``.
* ``RELEASE``: The version number or commit hash of the application (this is also sent to Sentry).
* ``NUM_PROXIES``: the number of reverse proxies in front of the application, as an integer. This is used to determine the actual client IP adres. On Kubernetes with an ingress you typically want to set this to 2. Defaults to: ``1``.
* ``CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS``: A list of trusted origins for unsafe requests (e.g. POST). Defaults to: ``[]``.
* ``NOTIFICATIONS_DISABLED``: indicates whether or not notifications should be sent to the Notificaties API for operations on the API endpoints. Defaults to ``True`` for the ``dev`` environment, otherwise defaults to ``False``.
* ``DISABLE_2FA``: Whether or not two factor authentication should be disabled. Defaults to: ``False``.
* ``LOG_OUTGOING_REQUESTS_EMIT_BODY``: Whether or not outgoing request bodies should be logged. Defaults to: ``True``.
* ``LOG_OUTGOING_REQUESTS_DB_SAVE``: Whether or not outgoing request logs should be saved to the database. Defaults to: ``False``.
* ``LOG_OUTGOING_REQUESTS_DB_SAVE_BODY``: Whether or not outgoing request bodies should be saved to the database. Defaults to: ``True``.
* ``LOG_OUTGOING_REQUESTS_MAX_AGE``: The amount of time after which request logs should be deleted from the database. Defaults to: ``7``.
* ``SENTRY_DSN``: URL of the sentry project to send error reports to. Default empty, i.e. -> no monitoring set up. Highly recommended to configure this.





Initial superuser creation (Docker only)
----------------------------------------

A clean installation of Objects API comes without pre-installed or pre-configured admin
user by default.

Users of Objects API can opt-in to provision an initial superuser via environment
variables. The user will only be created if it doesn't exist yet.

* ``OBJECTS_SUPERUSER_USERNAME``: specify the username of the superuser to create. Setting
  this to a non-empty value will enable the creation of the superuser. Default empty.
* ``OBJECTS_SUPERUSER_EMAIL``: specify the e-mail address to configure for the superuser.
  Defaults to `admin@admin.org`. Only has an effect if ``OBJECTS_SUPERUSER_USERNAME`` is set.
* ``OBJECTS_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD``: specify the password for the superuser. Default empty,
  which means the superuser will be created _without_ password. Only has an effect
  if ``OBJECTS_SUPERUSER_USERNAME`` is set.

Initial configuration
---------------------

Both Objects API and Objecttypes API support `setup_configuration` management command,
which allows configuration via environment variables.
All these environment variables are described at :ref:`command line <installation_config_cli>`.



Specifying the environment variables
=====================================

There are two strategies to specify the environment variables:

* provide them in a ``.env`` file
* start the component processes (with uwsgi/gunicorn/celery) in a process
  manager that defines the environment variables

Providing a .env file
---------------------

This is the most simple setup and easiest to debug. The ``.env`` file must be
at the root of the project - i.e. on the same level as the ``src`` directory (
NOT *in* the ``src`` directory).

The syntax is key-value:

.. code::

   SOME_VAR=some_value
   OTHER_VAR="quoted_value"


Provide the envvars via the process manager
-------------------------------------------

If you use a process manager (such as supervisor/systemd), use their techniques
to define the envvars. The component will pick them up out of the box.
